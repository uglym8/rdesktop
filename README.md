# rdesktop - A Remote Desktop Protocol client

rdesktop is an open source client for Microsoft's RDP protocol. It is
known to work with Windows versions ranging from NT 4 Terminal Server
to Windows 2012r2 RDS. rdesktop currently implements the RDP version 4
and 5 protocols.


## Installation

rdesktop uses a GNU-style build procedure.  Typically all that is necessary
to install rdesktop is the following::

	% ./configure
	% make
	% make install

The default is to install under `/usr/local`.  This can be changed by adding
`--prefix=<directory>` to the configure line.

The smart-card support module uses PCSC-lite. You should use PCSC-lite 1.2.9 or
later. To enable smart-card support in the rdesktop add `--enable-smartcard` to
the configure line.


## Note for users building from source

If you have retreived a snapshot of rdesktop source, you will first
need to run `./bootstrap` in order to generate the build infrastructure.
This is not necessary for release versions of rdesktop.


## Usage

Conenct to a RDP server like:

	% rdesktop server

where server is the name of the Terminal Services machine.  (If you receive
"Connection refused", this probably means that the server does not have
Terminal Services enabled, or there is a firewall blocking access.)

You can also specify a number of options on the command line.  These are listed
in the rdesktop manual page (run "man rdesktop").
